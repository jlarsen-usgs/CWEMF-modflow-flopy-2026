# MODFLOW 6 and Python workflows for developing MODFLOW models
MODFLOW is a three-dimensional hydrologic simulator that is developed and maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey and cooperating partners. MODFLOW 6 is the current “core” version of MODFLOW that is actively supported, developed, and maintained by the USGS. Newly developed capabilities extend MODFLOW from a groundwater flow simulator into a hydrologic simulator with many features not available in prior versions. FloPy is a python scripting language package for MODFLOW that can be used to build, edit, postprocess, and visualize MODFLOW simulations.  

The purpose of this course is to provide a high-level overview of MODFLOW 6 and FloPy coupled with in-depth activities. Participants will learn how to construct, edit, and post-process models in a Python environment with FloPy. The course schedule is as follows:

*Thursday, June 25th*

   - Overview of MODFLOW input and output files (10:45 - 11:15 AM)
   - Constructing a first MODFLOW model by hand (part 1; 11:15 AM - 12:00 PM)
   - Lunch (12:00 - 1:00 PM)
   - Constructing a first MODFLOW model by hand (part 2; 1:00 - 1:30PM)
   - *Notes : should we have an into/overview of Python, Jupyter, Pandas, and Geopandas?*

   - Putting it all together- Class Project: building a model in Python from disparate data (10:30 - 12:00 PM)  *todo: need to construct or select a model to do this with*
   - Lunch (12:00 - 1:00 PM)
   - Putting it all together- Class Project: building a model in Python from disparate data (1:00 - 2:00 PM)
   - Advanced topics as time allows; topics selected based on class interest (2:00 - 4:30 PM):
        - Stream capture scenarios 
        - Speeding up slow models with Parallel MODFLOW
        - Custom model boundary conditions and behavior using the MODFLOW API
