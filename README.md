# MODFLOW 6 and Python workflows for developing MODFLOW models
MODFLOW is a three-dimensional hydrologic simulator that is developed and maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey and cooperating partners. MODFLOW 6 is the current “core” version of MODFLOW that is actively supported, developed, and maintained by the USGS. Newly developed capabilities extend MODFLOW from a groundwater flow simulator into a hydrologic simulator with many features not available in prior versions. FloPy is a python scripting language package for MODFLOW that can be used to build, edit, postprocess, and visualize MODFLOW simulations.  

The purpose of this course is to provide a high-level overview of MODFLOW 6 and FloPy coupled with in-depth activities. Participants will learn how to construct, edit, and post-process models in a Python environment with FloPy. Course schedule is as follows:

*Thursday*
   - Introductions (8:30 - 9:00 AM)
   - Overview of the groundwater flow equation and MODFLOW CVFD methods (9:00 - 10:30 AM)
   - Break (10:30 - 10: 45 AM)
   - Overview of MODFLOW input and output files (10:45 - 11:15 AM)
   - Constructing a first MODFLOW model by hand (part 1; 11:15 AM - 12:00 PM)
   - Lunch (12:00 - 1:00 PM)
   - Constructing a first MODFLOW model by hand (part 2; 1:00 - 1:30PM)
   - Introduction to FloPy and constucting a MODFLOW model in Python (1:30 - 2:30 PM)
   - Break (2:30 - 2:45 pm)
   - Discretization strategies and workflows with Stuctured and Unstructured Grids (2:45 - 4:00 PM)
